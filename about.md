  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I am a provisionally licensed mental health clinician in the Omaha area. In 2012, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with a minor in Child, Youth, and Family from the University of Nebraska- Lincoln. In 2018, I graduated from an accredited program at the University of Nebraska- Omaha with a Master of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. </p>

  <p>Much of my experience and training has consisted of working with children and families impacted by child sexual abuse and neglect and children who engage in problematic sexual behavior. </p>

  <p>My primary treatment model is based on an evidenced based trauma focused cognitive behavioral (TF-CBT) model that integrates trauma sensitive interventions with cognitive behavioral strategies.</p>

  <p>At first, seeking therapy services can be uncomfortable and overwhelming. I want to be transparent with you now and throughout our time together. Therapy can be difficult work. You are the expert to your life and to your families. My goal is to make the therapy process as comfortable as possible and to be used as a resource to you and/or your family. </p>
