<h3>Family Therapy</h3>
<hr>

<p>Family therapy is required as I work with children impacted by child sexual abuse and/or problematic sexual behaviors. I use a trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) approach which illustrates that at least one caregiver be present and involved throughout the child’s treatment to provide additional support for the child and to receive psycho-education about the presenting concerns.</p>
